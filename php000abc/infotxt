The openssl extension is required for SSL/TLS protection but is not available.
If you can not enable the openssl extension, you can disable this error,
at your own risk, by setting the 'disable-tls' option to true.

php composer.phar config -g -- disable-tls true

extension_dir = "ext"
extension=curl
extension=openssl

php composer.phar install
php composer.phar update
